# JavaScript SDK for Aptabase

A tiny SDK (1 kB) to instrument your web app with Aptabase, a privacy-first analytics platform for desktop, mobile and web apps.  

> ðŸ‘‰ **IMPORTANT**
>
> This SDK is for **Web Applications**, not websites. There's a subtle, but important difference. A web app is often a lot more interactive and does not cause a full page reload when the user interacts with it. It's often called a **Single-Page Application**. A website, on the other hand, is a lot more content-focused like marketing sites, landing pages, blogs, etc. While you can certainly use Aptabase to track events on websites, please be aware that each page reload will be considered a new session.

## Install

Install the SDK using your preferred JavaScript package manager

```bash
pnpm add @aptabase/web
# or
npm add @aptabase/web
# or
yarn add @aptabase/web
```

## Usage

First you need to get your `App Key` from Aptabase, you can find it in the `Instructions` menu on the left side menu.

Initialized the SDK using your `App Key`:

```js
import { init } from "@aptabase/web";

init("<YOUR_APP_KEY>"); // ðŸ‘ˆ this is where you enter your App Key
```

The init function also supports an optional second parameter, which is an object with the `appVersion` property.

It's up to you to decide what to get the version of your app, but it's generally recommended to use your bundler (like Webpack, Vite, Rollup, etc.) to inject the values at build time.

Afterwards you can start tracking events with `trackEvent`:

```js
import { trackEvent } from "@aptabase/web";

trackEvent("connect_click"); // An event with no properties
trackEvent("play_music", { name: "Here comes the sun" }); // An event with a custom property
```

A few important notes:

1. The plugin will automatically enhance the event with some useful information, like the OS, the app version, and other things.
2. You're in control of what gets sent to Aptabase. This plugin does not automatically track any events, you need to call `trackEvent` manually.
   - Because of this, it's generally recommended to at least track an event at startup
3. You do not need to await the `trackEvent` function, it'll run in the background.
4. Only strings and numbers values are allowed on custom properties
